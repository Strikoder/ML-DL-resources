# StrikoderAIHub
Hey there! Welcome to the fun side of GitHub, StrikoderAIHub! Your go-to spot for a laugh and some top-notch Data Science, ML, and DL resources, all stirred up by yours truly, Strikoder.

What's Inside? 🎁
- Papers: Like bedtime stories, but for data geeks. :)
- .py & .ipynb: Where the code magic happens. ;)
- Deep Learning Models: They're kinda like my pet projects. Handle with care!

## The Fun Part 😄
Expect jokes, puns, and maybe learning something along the way. It's like mentorship, but cooler, because it's partially used to guide the next geeks of AI through the mystical lands of neovim. Check out the mentorship adventures at [Mentorship-public](https://github.com/Strikoder/Mentorship-public).

So, dive in! Whether you're here to crack a smile or crack some code, we've got you covered.

Catch ya on the code side,
Strikoder
